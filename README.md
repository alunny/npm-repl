# NPM Repl

> Play with browserified NPM repos in a browser

npm-repl was Node Knockout 2012 entry.

It's a little web server that npm-installs a given module, runs it through
browserify, and presents the browserified output in a CodeMirror repl.

There are a bunch of glaring errors with this approach, but it may be fun to
play with.
